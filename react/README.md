We love building slick shopping experiences for the big screen using awesome tech! If that's your jam, check out the challenge below and share your skills. :)

## The Task
We do shopping. Shopping has products. People like products. So, the challenge is to make some products that people like. Easy peasy.

  1. Make a generic Navbar with a logo, dummy search bar, and some fake menu items.
  2. In the main page, create a single-column layout with a handful of random Products (like a Feed view). Each Product should have an image, a title, and a price.
  3. Give each Product a Like button.
  4. When the Like button is clicked, it should toggle an "active" state. It should also increment/decrement a counter that represents the total number of "likes" for the associated Product.

## The Rules
No need to build a server/DB, this is front-end only and fake data is just fine. Please submit results within one week.

## Extra Credit
Not at all necessary, but we won't stop you. =)

  - Make the Like button update asynchronously (to simulate network overhead)
  - Do ^that optimistically ;-)
  - Persist app state to localStorage..?
  - Any other cool things you want
