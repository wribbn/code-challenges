# Work @ Wribbn

You're probably here because we invited you to take the next step in joining our team! Or maybe you just stumbled across this page by misspelling "ribbon" into a Google search, I don't know... Either way, if you love building slick, immersive, user-focused solutions to real-world problems you've come to the right place. :)

Wribbn does all things shopping, and we do it through great code. So if you like to shop and you write great code, check out the subfolders in this repo to see code challenges for their respective positions:

  - [backend](./backend)
  - [react](./react)
  - [react-native](./react-native)

Thanks, and have fun!
