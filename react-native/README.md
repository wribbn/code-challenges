# React Native
What's that? You want to make awesome native experiences that look great, feel even better, _and_ you wanna have fun while doing it? Sweet, so do we. Complete this challenge and we can be best buds. :)

## Le Challenge
We do shopping. Shopping has products. People like products. So, the challenge is to make some products that people like. Boom.

  1. Make a generic Header that says "Products" or something.
  2. Make a scrollable list containing a handful of random Products. Each Product should have an image, a title, and a price.
  3. Give each Product a Like button.
  4. When the Like button is clicked, it should toggle an "active" state. It should also increment/decrement a counter that represents the total number of "likes" for the associated Product.

## The Rules
This is a front-end only task, and dummy data is totally fine!

## Bonuses (Boni?)
Completely optional, but if you're feeling ambitious. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

  - Make the Like button update asynchronously (to simulate network overhead)
  - Do ^that optimistically ;-)
  - Use a carousel for multiple images per product..?
  - Any other cool things you want
